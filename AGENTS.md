# Codex Guidance for Nox

Use `docs/nox-project-spec.md` as the canonical product specification. Keep `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/implementation-plan.md` updated after every major implementation change.

## Current State

This repo has a buildable backend with per-session SQLite persistence, a synchronous CLI safe scan path, and asynchronous API scan start. Active scans run built-in `http-probe` and `security-headers` plus optional subprocess adapters for `nmap`, `ffuf`, `sqlmap`, and `dalfox`. API scans publish WebSocket lifecycle events at `GET /api/scan/{id}/events` while keeping polling endpoints as fallback. The dashboard reads real sessions, stats, findings, and live progress from the API. The React/Vite frontend builds into `internal/api/web/dist` and is embedded into the Go binary. The backend targets Go 1.26; keep it buildable with `go test ./...` after every change.

## Engineering Priorities

- Scope validation is a security boundary. Every adapter that makes network requests must validate target host/IP first.
- Normalize all tool output into `internal/models.Finding`.
- Persist raw evidence. Do not discard stdout, stderr, HTTP requests, or HTTP responses.
- Prefer deterministic rule logic for attack vectors; LLM output should annotate, not decide correctness.
- Keep external scanner tools optional and degrade gracefully when missing.
- Default to local-only operation: no telemetry, no required cloud API keys.

## Suggested Next Tasks

Proceed in order from the lowest incomplete phase in `docs/implementation-plan.md`. Phases 0 and 1 are complete from the repository perspective; the next focus is Phase 2:

1. Expand SQLite migrations for HTTP evidence, technologies, CVE matches, attack vectors, LLM history, plugins, and schema migration tracking.
2. Persist raw HTTP request/response evidence separately from normalized findings.
3. Persist technologies, CVE matches, attack vectors, and attack steps.
4. Add database repository methods and tests for the expanded schema.
5. Preserve compatibility for current per-session SQLite databases where possible.
